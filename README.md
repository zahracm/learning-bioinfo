## Learning bioinformatics as a (non) CS and (non) biologist

Hi! this will be a growing post where i put the learning resources that i found it helpful in understanding bioinformatics, as a people without computer science nor biology background. 

If you are from CS or biology, i found that there were already bunch of information available to catch up for bioinformatics

One of my favourite are [OMG Genomics](https://www.youtube.com/@OMGenomics/videos) and [Base Call](https://www.youtube.com/@BaseCalling/videos)

So here we go from the very starch 

### Programming
Back in 2010, I have learn a little bit of HTML and CSS but i have just know that it is not consider a programming language. After I began to work, I started to exposed to Phyton, R, and STATA, but never really put effort to actually learn it. Some people in the internet suggested to master one programming language first and after that the basic knowledge of that language will be helpful in learning other language. Many artciles suggested to start with Phyton as it is more general language (can be applied to app development, data science, and even other sophisticated things that i can not mention) and follow with R.

**The Python Bible: Zihad Yeiha**
This basic Phyton course is availabe in Udemy. It includes 11 section with total of 74 lectures covering the basic variable types in phyton, logic and conditional flow, looping, functions, and object oriented programming. One lecture takes around 3-10 minnutes each. Total time needed to finish this course is 9hours. Perfect to binge watch over the weekend.

1. Every explanation on variable type comes with the drawing illustration that made it clear for a person with zero background to understand. 
2. At the end of some lecture, there is project that we will need to actively participate. I found it really helpful to remember the code by typing it not only copy and paste. The generator will tell us if our code if wrong. At the end we made tic tac toe games!
3. Its packed on short videos and there is summary of the session every end of the section.

I really can not think the disadvantage of this course.
But maybe if you are more into free course, this is a paid course. But I got discounted price only $4.6 from $48.9 :laughing:
:satisfied: I think if you are a new Udemy user, you will also get this price!


### Mollecular biology
Oh, don't ask when was my last biology course, 2013 i think?
But i know that i always love studying it, learning how our body works is superfascinating, knowing that a little part of my body works really hard for me to continue living sometimes also add up motivations for me to do better. 

**DNA Decoded: McMaster University**
This course is available in [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/dna-decoded). FYI for free acces to the course, in coursera we select Audit course in the enrollment options (of course there will be some limitation, but we can acces all the learning materials). This course has a total duration of 23 hours and designed to be finished by 4 weeks (but its actually can be adjusted). The course cover the basic concept of DNA, central dogma of mollecular biology, and other application. It said that the course was for Intermediate level, but since they are explaining the very basic terms I think the university student can also follow it, maybe in slower pace and repeat the video if needed.

1. There explanation is very clear and the lecturer gives example using part of dailiy activities so we can relate more! really some of the cases and example is brilliant
2. There are cases and excercise to be finished at the end of the couse, not a very difficult one but also not easy, good enough to understand more about the lecture
3. There is always explanation for new terms that come out in every session, the two lecturers remind each other if the pace is too quick

since I am still not yet finished this course, will update more later and more course to be added!
